Information Theory and Reinforcement Learning

Implementation of information theory of "The information bottleneck" paper
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0004057.pdf). 
Using information theory tools to evaluate the performance of various neural networks in the same fashion as the 
"Opening the Black Box of Deep Neural Networks via Information" paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00810)
